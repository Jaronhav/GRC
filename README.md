# 📘 Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Knowledge Base

## Overview  
This private repository serves as a **personal reference library** of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) documentation, frameworks, and policies.  
It centralizes **non-confidential** materials, notes, and references to publicly available standards (e.g., NIST, ISO, CJIS, and state cybersecurity frameworks) to support ongoing professional development and operational readiness for a GRC role—particularly within **state and law enforcement environments**.

## Purpose  
The goal of this repository is to:

- Maintain an organized, searchable knowledge base of **GRC frameworks, policies, and controls**  
- Reference **official publications and standards** relevant to information assurance and risk management in the public sector  
- Develop and refine **internal documentation templates**, **risk assessment workflows**, and **policy examples** aligned with industry best practices  
- Serve as a living repository for **continuous learning and professional growth**
